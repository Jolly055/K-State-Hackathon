# K-State-Hackathon
Python plays a pivotal role in many aspects of this project. Two key repositories, chosen for their sponsorship tracks, prizes, and selectivity, are essential for its functioning.
The first, Redis, is a simplistic database manager and analyzer that provides a fast and efficient way to store and retrieve data.
The second, Taipy, is a lightweight and accessible HTML-type programming language that enables developers to create functional and user-friendly interfaces without requiring extensive knowledge of traditional web development languages.

When testing this project make sure to import both the redis and the taipy, otherwise the program will NOT work. The way to install is going to a terminal and imputting in: 'pip install taipy redis'.
